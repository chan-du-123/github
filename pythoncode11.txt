11. """Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit 
binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 
or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma 
separated sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
