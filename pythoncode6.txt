6. """Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given 
formula:
Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-
separated sequence.For example Let us assume the following comma 
separated input sequence is given to the program:
100,150,180
The output of the program should be:
