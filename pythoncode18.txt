18. """A website requires the users to input username and password to register. 
Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Following are the criteria for checking the password:
 At least 1 letter between [a-z]
 At least 1 number between [0-9]
 At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
 At least 1 character from [$#@]
 Minimum length of transaction password: 6
 Maximum length of transaction password: 12
Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and 
will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the 
criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
Example
If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
Then, the output of the program should be:
ABd1234@1"""

    if len(password) < 6 or len(password) > 12:
        return False
    if not re.search("[a-z]", password):
        return False
    if not re.search("[A-Z]", password):
        return False
    if not re.search("[0-9]", password):
        return False
    if not re.search("[$#@]", password):
        return False
    return True


passwords = input("Enter comma-separated passwords: ").split(",")
